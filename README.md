# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning 

This mini-project explore different kind of machine learning algorithms and feature selection technique
on the credit card fraud detection dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.
The project is divided into two notebooks one for Exploratory data analysis and one for machine learning models training.

In the first part, I analyzed the distribution of the feature and normalized unbalanced features, and for the feature selection step, I use logistic regression to decide which features are most relevant to this problem.

In the second part after data understanding and cleaning, We will test our new process data on several machine learning algorithms and one deep neural network ANN and compare the results between the different models.
